Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager for Remote Administration provides end users and administrators with the ability to securely manage remote IIS servers (version 7 and above) from Windows clients (XP and above). A Web server administrator can perform almost all IIS administrative tasks while site owners and developers that have been delegated administrative privileges can use IIS Manager for Remote Administration to make allowed changes to the remote Web server. IIS Manager for Remote offers the same user interface available on Windows Server to ensure a more consistent experience when managing and configuring the Web server.
